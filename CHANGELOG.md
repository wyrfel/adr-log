  They are removed when generating the log.
  Fixes [#23](https://github.com/adr/adr-log/issues/23).

### Changed

- Really using the format of "Keep a Changelog": Versions are indicated without prefix `v`.
  E.g., `v1.0.0` is now `1.0.0`.
  This is also the format supported by @sindresorhus's [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

### Changed

- Updated CLI syntax to be more conform with [markdown-toc](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc).

### Fixed

- The title of the first main heading is used (and not the second line if it is not empty). [#15](https://github.com/adr/adr-log/issues/15)
- When `adrlog` appears without closing `adrlogstop`, adr-log does not stop with an error anymore.
- When `adrlog` does not appear, the log is created nevertheless.
